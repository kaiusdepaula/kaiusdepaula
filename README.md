With a strong academic foundation in Economics from the Federal University of Vi√ßosa, I've honed my skills over years of practical experience. My journey has been marked by unraveling complex datasets, building predictive models, and advocating for the power of data-driven decision-making.

In my 3+ years in the field, I've delved into diverse projects and technologies, specializing in time series forecasting, classification, and recommendation systems. My commitment to enhancing understanding through data extends beyond the technical realm ‚Äì I've also published research on the impact of socio-economic factors on education.

# üöÄ Expertise
My central passion revolves around data science, where I specialize in unearthing valuable insights from complex datasets. With an adept command of Python, R, SQL, and Power BI, I navigate the intricacies of data to empower informed decision-making. My focus lies in predictive modeling, time series analysis, and creating intuitive visualizations to facilitate comprehensive understanding.

I find great satisfaction in translating data into actionable strategies that drive real-world impact. By combining my analytical rigor with a keen eye for detail, I'm committed to illuminating patterns that guide smarter choices. My journey in the realm of data has not only refined my technical skills but also deepened my appreciation for the stories data can tell.
